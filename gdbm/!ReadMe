This archive contains new versions of the gdbm module and RDBM_File. There
is a new SWI, Gdbm_OpenIn, for gdbm, and RDBM_File has been modified to make
it more like its UNIX counterparts. (This version of RDBM_File is intended for
use with RiscOs release 1.51 of Perl 5.001. For use with the beta release
of Perl 5.004, the SWI interface must be modified.) The C-source for gdbm
is available from me at the email address below.

Please read the file 'Versions' before installing them. This is particularly
important for RDBM_File, which is not totally backwards compatible. The
module gdbm should be placed in !System.modules and RDBM_File in the
!Perl.riscos.pm directory.

Users of the invaluable StrongHelp SWI index may have noticed that the
documentation of Gdbm_Open is incorrect. The directory Gdbm_ here corrects
that and also documents the new call. Start StrongHelp and click on the SWI
link. This displays a window entitled SWI. Click 'Menu' and select 'Open
Directory' to display a filer window. Replace the directory Gdbm_ with the one
given here to update the data.
