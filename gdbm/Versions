S.W.Ellacott@brighton.ac.uk

0.04 (13 Feb 2003)
Recompiled for 32bit compatibility (Alex Waugh)

0.03 (11 Jul 1997)
a) Added new SWI Gdbm_OpenIn (&4CC49)
	As Gdbm_Open but file is opened for reading only, enabling more than
	one task to access the file simultaneously.
b) SWIs now return 0 if no handle exists (eg if a file failed to open)

0.02 (24 Jun 1997)
a) Used low level file calls to avoid 13 ANSI file limit of Acorn C.
b) Added finalisation code to close files if the module is killed.

Versions of RDBM_File
---------------------
S.W.Ellacott@brighton.ac.uk

3. Mon 14th July 1997 (requires gdbm version 0.03)
a) Modified to be more compatible with UNIX dbm managers. NB this version is not
entirely backwards compatible.
The commands
	use RDBM_File;
	tie(%hash, RDBM_File, filename, flags, mode);
are not interpreted as follows:
The array '%hash' is tied to the file 'filename' using the package RDBM_File
(as in Version 2). The 'mode' parameter, if present, is ignored. The flags
parameter is now interpreted in a simililar way to DB_File. If 'flags' is 0,
the file is opened for reading only. This means that more than one hash, even
from different tasks, can access the file at the same time. If bit 2 is set,
the file is opened for reading and writing, and if bit 4 is set, the file is
created if it does not already exist. Thus 
	flags = 0	Open for reading only
	flags = 8	Open for read/write
	flags = 10	Open for read/write, creating if necessary.
Note that this means that 'tie(%hash, RDBM_File, filename)' or 
tie(%hash, RDBM_File, filename,0) will open the file for reading only, whereas
previously it would have opened for reading and writing.
b) To support the above change, package RDBM_File now exports the symbols
O_RDONLY, O_RDWR, O_CREAT, returning values of 0,2 and 8 respectively. So
to open a file for reading and writing, creating if necessary, put
	tie(%hash, RDBM_File, filename, O_RDWR|O_CREAT); .
c) If a file fails to open, RDBM_File now returns 0 rather than dying. So you
need to test the value returned by tie or dbmopen to see if the file opened
successfully. (However version 0.03 of gdbm is less likely to crash than
previous versions if you do not do this: you will simply not get any values
returned.)
d) If you try and access a value not previously defined, it is now set to
0 rather than undef. So if you write '$hash{key}++' where '$hash{key}' has
no previous value, $hash{key} is set to 1, instead of causing an error. (In my
opinion this is not logical, but some UNIX scripts seem to require it:-{)
