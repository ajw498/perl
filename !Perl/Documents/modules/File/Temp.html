<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p><code>File::Temp</code> can be used to create and open temporary files in a safe
way.  There is both a function interface and an object-oriented
interface.  The File::Temp constructor or the <a href="#item_tempfile"><code>tempfile()</code></a> function can
be used to return the name and the open filehandle of a temporary
file.  The <a href="#item_tempdir"><code>tempdir()</code></a> function can be used to create a temporary
directory.</p>
<p>The security aspect of temporary file creation is emphasized such that
a filehandle and filename are returned together.  This helps guarantee
that a race condition can not occur where the temporary file is
created by another process between checking for the existence of the
file and its opening.  Additional security levels are provided to
check, for example, that the sticky bit is set on world writable
directories.  See <a href="#safe_level">safe_level</a> for more information.</p>
<p>For compatibility with popular C library functions, Perl implementations of
the <a href="#item_mkstemp"><code>mkstemp()</code></a> family of functions are provided. These are, mkstemp(),
mkstemps(), <a href="#item_mkdtemp"><code>mkdtemp()</code></a> and mktemp().</p>
<p>Additionally, implementations of the standard <a href="../arm/POSIX.html">POSIX</a>
<a href="#item_tmpnam"><code>tmpnam()</code></a> and <a href="#item_tmpfile"><code>tmpfile()</code></a> functions are provided if required.</p>
<p>Implementations of mktemp(), tmpnam(), and <a href="#item_tempnam"><code>tempnam()</code></a> are provided,
but should be used with caution since they return only a filename
that was valid when function was called, so cannot guarantee
that the file will not exist by the time the caller opens the filename.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="oo_interface">OO INTERFACE</a></h1>
<p>This is the primary interface for interacting with
<code>File::Temp</code>. Using the OO interface a temporary file can be created
when the object is constructed and the file can be removed when the
object is no longer required.</p>
<p>Note that there is no method to obtain the filehandle from the
<code>File::Temp</code> object. The object itself acts as a filehandle. Also,
the object is configured such that it stringifies to the name of the
temporary file.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_new"><strong>new</strong></a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Create a temporary file object.
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  my $tmp = new File::Temp();</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>by default the object is constructed as if <a href="#item_tempfile"><code>tempfile</code></a>
was called without options, but with the additional behaviour
that the temporary file is removed by the object destructor
if UNLINK is set to true (the default).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Supported arguments are the same as for <a href="#item_tempfile"><code>tempfile</code></a>: UNLINK
(defaulting to true), DIR and SUFFIX. Additionally, the filename
template is specified using the TEMPLATE option. The OPEN option
is not supported (the file is always opened).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
 $tmp = new File::Temp( TEMPLATE =&gt; 'tempXXXXX',
                        DIR =&gt; 'mydir',
                        SUFFIX =&gt; '.dat');</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Arguments are case insensitive.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_filename"><strong>filename</strong></a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Return the name of the temporary file associated with this object.
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  $filename = $tmp-&gt;filename;</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This method is called automatically when the object is used as
a string.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_destroy"><strong>DESTROY</strong></a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
When the object goes out of scope, the destructor is called. This
destructor will attempt to unlink the file (using <a href="#item_unlink1"><code>unlink1</code></a>)
if the constructor was called with UNLINK set to 1 (the default state
if UNLINK is not specified).
</dd>
<dd>
<p>No error is given if the unlink fails.</p>

<h1><a name="functions">FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
<p>This section describes the recommended interface for generating
temporary files and directories.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_tempfile"><strong>tempfile</strong></a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
This is the basic function to generate temporary files.
The behaviour of the file can be changed using various options:
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  ($fh, $filename) = tempfile();</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Create a temporary file in  the directory specified for temporary
files, as specified by the <code>tmpdir()</code> function in <a href="Spec.html">the File::Spec manpage</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  ($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template);</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Create a temporary file in the current directory using the supplied
template.  Trailing `X' characters are replaced with random letters to
generate the filename.  At least four `X' characters must be present
at the end of the template.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  ($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, SUFFIX =&gt; $suffix)</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Same as previously, except that a suffix is added to the template
after the `X' translation.  Useful for ensuring that a temporary
filename has a particular extension when needed by other applications.
But see the WARNING at the end.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  ($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, DIR =&gt; $dir);</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Translates the template as before except that a directory name
is specified.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  ($fh, $filename) = tempfile($template, UNLINK =&gt; 1);</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Return the filename and filehandle as before except that the file is
automatically removed when the program exits. Default is for the file
to be removed if a file handle is requested and to be kept if the
filename is requested. In a scalar context (where no filename is
returned) the file is always deleted either on exit or when it is closed.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If the template is not specified, a template is always
automatically generated. This temporary file is placed in <code>tmpdir()</code>
(<a href="Spec.html">the File::Spec manpage</a>) unless a directory is specified explicitly with the
DIR option.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  $fh = tempfile( $template, DIR =&gt; $dir );</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If called in scalar context, only the filehandle is returned
and the file will automatically be deleted when closed (see
the description of <a href="#item_tmpfile"><code>tmpfile()</code></a> elsewhere in this document).
This is the preferred mode of operation, as if you only
have a filehandle, you can never create a race condition
by fumbling with the filename. On systems that can not unlink
an open file or can not mark a file as temporary when it is opened
(for example, Windows NT uses the <code>O_TEMPORARY</code> flag)
the file is marked for deletion when the program ends (equivalent
to setting UNLINK to 1). The <code>UNLINK</code> flag is ignored if present.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  (undef, $filename) = tempfile($template, OPEN =&gt; 0);</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This will return the filename based on the template but
will not open this file.  Cannot be used in conjunction with
UNLINK set to true. Default is to always open the file
to protect from possible race conditions. A warning is issued
if warnings are turned on. Consider using the <a href="#item_tmpnam"><code>tmpnam()</code></a>
and <a href="#item_mktemp"><code>mktemp()</code></a> functions described elsewhere in this document
if opening the file is not required.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Options can be combined as required.</p>
</dd>
<p></p>
<dt><strong><a name="item_tempdir"><strong>tempdir</strong></a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
This is the recommended interface for creation of temporary directories.
The behaviour of the function depends on the arguments:
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  $tempdir = tempdir();</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Create a directory in <code>tmpdir()</code> (see <a href="Spec.html">File::Spec</a>).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  $tempdir = tempdir( $template );</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Create a directory from the supplied template. This template is
similar to that described for tempfile(). `X' characters at the end
of the template are replaced with random letters to construct the
directory name. At least four `X' characters must be in the template.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  $tempdir = tempdir ( DIR =&gt; $dir );</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Specifies the directory to use for the temporary directory.
The temporary directory name is derived from an internal template.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  $tempdir = tempdir ( $template, DIR =&gt; $dir );</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Prepend the supplied directory name to the template. The template
should not include parent directory specifications itself. Any parent
directory specifications are removed from the template before
prepending the supplied directory.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  $tempdir = tempdir ( $template, TMPDIR =&gt; 1 );</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Using the supplied template, create the temporary directory in
a standard location for temporary files. Equivalent to doing</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  $tempdir = tempdir ( $template, DIR =&gt; File::Spec-&gt;tmpdir);</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>but shorter. Parent directory specifications are stripped from the
template itself. The <code>TMPDIR</code> option is ignored if <code>DIR</code> is set
explicitly.  Additionally, <code>TMPDIR</code> is implied if neither a template
nor a directory are supplied.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  $tempdir = tempdir( $template, CLEANUP =&gt; 1);</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Create a temporary directory using the supplied template, but
attempt to remove it (and all files inside it) when the program
exits. Note that an attempt will be made to remove all files from
the directory even if they were not created by this module (otherwise
why ask to clean it up?). The directory removal is made with
the <code>rmtree()</code> function from the <a href="Path.html">File::Path</a> module.
Of course, if the template is not specified, the temporary directory
will be created in <code>tmpdir()</code> and will also be removed at program exit.</p>

<h1><a name="posix_functions">POSIX FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
<p>This section describes the re-implementation of the <a href="#item_tmpnam"><code>tmpnam()</code></a>

using the <a href="#item_mkstemp"><code>mkstemp()</code></a> from this module.</p>
<p>Unlike the <a href="../arm/POSIX.html">POSIX</a> implementations, the directory used
for the temporary file is not specified in a system include
file (<code>P_tmpdir</code>) but simply depends on the choice of <code>tmpdir()</code>
returned by <a href="Spec.html">File::Spec</a>. On some implementations this
location can be set using the <code>TMPDIR</code> environment variable, which
may not be secure.
If this is a problem, simply use <a href="#item_mkstemp"><code>mkstemp()</code></a> and specify a template.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_tmpnam"><strong>tmpnam</strong></a></strong><br />

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_unlink0"><strong>unlink0</strong></a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Given an open filehandle and the associated filename, make a safe
unlink. This is achieved by first checking that the filename and
filehandle initially point to the same file and that the number of
links to the file is 1 (all fields returned by <code>stat()</code> are compared).
Then the filename is unlinked and the filehandle checked once again to
verify that the number of links on that file is now 0.  This is the
closest you can come to making sure that the filename unlinked was the
same as the file whose descriptor you hold.
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  unlink0($fh, $path) or die &quot;Error unlinking file $path safely&quot;;</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Returns false on error. The filehandle is not closed since on some
occasions this is not required.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>On some platforms, for example Windows NT, it is not possible to
unlink an open file (the file must be closed first). On those
platforms, the actual unlinking is deferred until the program ends and
good status is returned. A check is still performed to make sure that
the filehandle and filename are pointing to the same thing (but not at
the time the end block is executed since the deferred removal may not
have access to the filehandle).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Additionally, on Windows NT not all the fields returned by <code>stat()</code> can
be compared. For example, the <code>dev</code> and <code>rdev</code> fields seem to be
different.  Also, it seems that the size of the file returned by <code>stat()</code>
does not always agree, with <code>stat(FH)</code> being more accurate than
<code>stat(filename)</code>, presumably because of caching issues even when
using autoflush (this is usually overcome by waiting a while after
writing to the tempfile before attempting to <a href="#item_unlink0"><code>unlink0</code></a> it).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Finally, on NFS file systems the link count of the file handle does
not always go to zero immediately after unlinking. Currently, this

Compare <code>stat</code> of filehandle with <code>stat</code> of provided filename.  This

<dd>
<pre>

<p>On certain platofms, eg Windows, not all the fields returned by <code>stat()</code>
can be compared. For example, the <code>dev</code> and <code>rdev</code> fields seem to be
different in Windows.  Also, it seems that the size of the file
returned by <code>stat()</code> does not always agree, with <code>stat(FH)</code> being more

Similar to <a href="#item_unlink0"><code>unlink0</code></a> except after file comparison using cmpstat, the
filehandle is closed prior to attempting to unlink the file. This

<code>_PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED</code> symbol (for example, Windows NT) it is
assumed that ``chown() giveaway'' is possible and the recursive test
is performed.</p>
</dd>
<p></p></dl>
<p>The level can be changed as follows:</p>
<pre>
  File::Temp-&gt;safe_level( File::Temp::HIGH );</pre>
<p>The level constants are not exported by the module.</p>
<p>Currently, you must be running at least perl v5.6.0 in order to
run with MEDIUM or HIGH security. This is simply because the
safety tests use functions from <a href="../arm/Fcntl.html">Fcntl</a> that are not
available in older versions of perl. The problem is that the version
number for Fcntl is the same in perl 5.6.0 and in 5.005_03 even though
they are different versions.</p>
<p>On systems that do not support the HIGH or MEDIUM safety levels
(for example Win NT or OS/2) any attempt to change the level will
be ignored. The decision to ignore rather than raise an exception
allows portable programs to be written with high security in mind
for the systems that can support this without those programs failing
on systems where the extra tests are irrelevant.</p>
<p>If you really need to see whether the change has been accepted
simply examine the return value of <a href="#item_safe_level"><code>safe_level</code></a>.</p>
<pre>
  $newlevel = File::Temp-&gt;safe_level( File::Temp::HIGH );
  die &quot;Could not change to high security&quot;
      if $newlevel != File::Temp::HIGH;</pre>
<dt><strong><a name="item_topsystemuid">TopSystemUID</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
This is the highest UID on the current system that refers to a root
UID. This is used to make sure that the temporary directory is
owned by a system UID (<code>root</code>, <code>bin</code>, <code>sys</code> etc) rather than
simply by root.
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This is required since on many unix systems <code>/tmp</code> is not owned
by root.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Default is to assume that any UID less than or equal to 10 is a root
UID.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  File::Temp-&gt;top_system_uid(10);
  my $topid = File::Temp-&gt;top_system_uid;</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This value can be adjusted to reduce security checking if required.
The value is only relevant when <a href="#item_safe_level"><code>safe_level</code></a> is set to MEDIUM or higher.</p>
</dd>

<h1><a name="warning">WARNING</a></h1>
<p>For maximum security, endeavour always to avoid ever looking at,
touching, or even imputing the existence of the filename.  You do not
know that that filename is connected to the same file as the handle
you have, and attempts to check this can only trigger more race
conditions.  It's far more secure to use the filehandle alone and
dispense with the filename altogether.</p>
<p>If you need to pass the handle to something that expects a filename
then, on a unix system, use <code>&quot;/dev/fd/&quot; . fileno($fh)</code> for arbitrary
programs, or more generally <code>&quot;+&lt;=&amp;&quot; . fileno($fh)</code> for Perl
programs.  You will have to clear the close-on-exec bit on that file
descriptor before passing it to another process.</p>
<pre>
    use Fcntl qw/F_SETFD F_GETFD/;
    fcntl($tmpfh, F_SETFD, 0)
        or die &quot;Can't clear close-on-exec flag on temp fh: $!\n&quot;;</pre>
<p>

<h2><a name="temporary_files_and_nfs">Temporary files and NFS</a></h2>
<p>Some problems are associated with using temporary files that reside
on NFS file systems and it is recommended that a local filesystem
is used whenever possible. Some of the security tests will most probably
fail when the temp file is not local. Additionally, be aware that
the performance of I/O operations over NFS will not be as good as for
a local disk.</p>

<h1><a name="history">HISTORY</a></h1>
<p>Originally began life in May 1999 as an XS interface to the system
<a href="#item_mkstemp"><code>mkstemp()</code></a> function. In March 2000, the OpenBSD <a href="#item_mkstemp"><code>mkstemp()</code></a> code was
translated to Perl for total control of the code's
security checking, to ensure the presence of the function regardless of
operating system and to help with portability.</p>
