RISC OS Port of Perl 5.8.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the first release of Perl 5.8.6 for RISC OS. It is supplied
under either the Artistic License or the GNU General Public License - see
the files in the License directory for more information.

You should copy the !Perl application somewhere suitable, and ensure it
is booted by the filer before use.  Do not attempt to merge it with
older !Perl applications. You will also need the SharedUnixLibrary
module 1.05 or later, which is available from http://gccsdk.riscos.info/
Documentation on non RISC OS specific aspects is located in
!Perl.Documents.

I have tried to keep the changes needed for this port to a minimum, so
that the effort in maintaining the port is kept to a minimum, and
keeping the port up to date should be easier. See the Source directory
for the changes needed. It was cross compiled with the GCCSDK.

There are currently no RISC OS specific modules supplied as there have
been for earlier ports. If you would like to use any of these, then
email me with details of which ones and I may consider adding them if
there is sufficient demand.

If you have problems or find bugs, please either report them to me or
to the RISC OS Perl mailing list (Send an email to
riscos-subscribe@perl.org to join). The mailing list is generally
preferable, as it gives more people a chance to answer, and others can
benefit from any reply.
